NPCs/Enemies
I will be creating and implementing NPCs and Enemies for the player to interact with and fight.
As Team Lead 5, my feature is to design and implement AI into our game. 
I have done this in the form of creating non-player characters as well as enemies for the player to fight. 
I have also made a partial demo mode for the game to “play itself” automatically.
